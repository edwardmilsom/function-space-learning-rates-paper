Temporary repo for anonymous submission. Apologies for the mess.

Code for FLeRM / recording function-space learning rates is found in normalised_optimiser.py.

mlpcifar10/mlp_cifar10.py is the training script for the ResMLP, which shows how the code in normalised_optimiser.py is used with a model. pytorch_transformer_example/claudemain_wrapper_load_masses.py is the training script for the transformer.
